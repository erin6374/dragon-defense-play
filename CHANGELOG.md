# Dragon Defense v5.3.0 — North Broad Street

This release builds on v5.2.3 (`edc333709757933903c70e2bef93c2e439507059`).

- Switched the gameplay view to a perspective camera. Streets, neighboring buildings and the school stay in fixed world coordinates while the camera follows the dragon. Only the distant skyline and low foreground planting use decorative offsets.
- Restored depth testing for the dragon and added a transition from the rooftop perch to the street flight lane. The school still uses the original FBX geometry and its existing localized damage and collapse paths.
- Reworked the Broad Street lane markings, crosswalks and vacant lot. Connected the two cross streets to the deeper street grid and extended the geometry visible past both intersections.
- Tuned school brick and window colors against the Street View frontage. Added world-space masonry courses to the source façade. Reframed the Liberty Place, Comcast and City Hall silhouettes against a deeper sky with varied façade lighting.
- Suppressed empty broken-building batches until they contain debris. Distant neighborhood batches can now be culled as the camera pans.

## Reference decisions

The eight supplied Street View screenshots were used for the window-bank proportions, contrasting adjoining buildings, vacant lot and street markings. The supplied cinematic mockup guided the camera height, distant landmark order, dusk palette and foreground planting. Philadelphia's [address geocoder](https://api.phila.gov/ais/v1/search/2221%20N%20BROAD%20ST) and [building footprints](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/building-footprints/) confirm the site and the approximate school height (89 ft, about 27 m). The [project architect's photographs](https://cicadaphiladelphia.squarespace.com/education/tech-freire) document the high front lobby and glazing. The [Comcast campus photographs](https://www.visitphilly.com/things-to-do/attractions/comcast-center-campus/) informed the two tower silhouettes.

The district uses a compressed game-space street grid. The far skyline is a composed landmark view and the west-side planting is set dressing. The source geometry still provides the main façade and original openings. The visual fidelity of the double-height interior, vehicle lighting and individual parcels requires separate visual verification.
